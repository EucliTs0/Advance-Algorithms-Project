Inheritance basic concept Object-Oriented Programming
basic idea create new classes add extra detail
existing classes. This done allowing new classes reuse
methods variables existing classes new methods
classes added specialise new class. Inheritance models
is-kind-of relationship entities (or objects), example,
postgraduates undergraduates kinds student. This kind
relationship visualised tree structure, student
would general root node postgraduate
undergraduate would specialised extensions student
node (or child nodes). In relationship student would
known superclass parent class whereas, postgraduate would
known subclass child class postgraduate
class extends student class.

Inheritance occur several layers, visualised would
display larger tree structure. For example, could extend
postgraduate node adding two extra extended classes
called, MSc Student PhD Student types student
kinds postgraduate student. This would mean MSc
Student PhD Student classes would inherit methods variables
postgraduate student classes.
