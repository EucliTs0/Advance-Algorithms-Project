the vector space model also called term vector model algebraic model used represent text documents well objects general vectors identifiers it used information retrieval first used smart information retrieval system

a document represented vector dimension corresponds separate term if term appears document value vector nonzero many different ways calculating values also known term weights developed one best known methods called tfidf weighting

the definition term depends application generally terms single words keywords longer phrases if words chosen terms dimensionality vector number words vocabulary number distinct words occurring corpus

the vector space model several disadvantages firstly long documents represented badly poor similarity values secondly search keywords must accurately match document terms substrings words might result falsepositive match thirdly documents similar context different term vocabulary associated resulting falsenegative match finally order terms appear document lost vector space representation
