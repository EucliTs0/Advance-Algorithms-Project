using vector space model information retrieval models pages
queries highdimensional sparse vectors each item vector
represents different keyword

the similiarity betweeen two pages query page computed
using dot product formula find cosine them this
represents angle them ndimensional space results
range 1 1 1 close match normally vectors
negative values results always greater
equal 0 the cosine computed using cos a  abab
