vector space model algebraic model representing text documents and general objects vectors identifiers as example index terms its first use smart information retrieval system it used information filtering information retrieval indexing relevancy rankings

a document represented vector dimension corresponds separate term if term occurs document value vector nonzero several different ways computing values also known term weights developed the definition term depends application typically terms single words keywords longer phrases if words chosen terms dimensionality vector number words vocabulary the number distinct words occurring corpus

one best known schemes tfidf weighting proposed salton wong yang in classic vector space model term specific weights document vectors products local global parameters

relevancy rankings documents keyword search calculated using assumptions document similarities theory comparing deviation angles document vector original query vector query represented kind vector documents

the vector space model following limitations

 search keywords must precisely match document terms word substrings might result false positive match
 semantic sensitivity documents similar context different term vocabulary wont associated resulting false negative match
 the order terms appear document lost vector space representation
 long documents poorly represented poor similarity values a small scalar product large dimensionality
