in field computer science term dynamic programming relates style programming breaks large problem smaller subproblems generally allows finding optimal solution when problem split subproblems may split smaller problems on cannot reduced more
it also common dynamic programming make use recursion saving previous results faster computation later also leads higher efficiency calculations redone for example problem reduced sub problems reduced further may common subsubproblems one calculation needs done result saved help solve one subproblem
an example gain efficiency pathfinding problem if two distinct routes network 10 nodes tagged a j two routes share common section say nodes b d cost section calculated first route saved then second route processed cost b d need calculated again
in general dynamic programming used optimisation problems efficient solution needed areas sort programming useful ai computer graphics compression routines biomedical applications
