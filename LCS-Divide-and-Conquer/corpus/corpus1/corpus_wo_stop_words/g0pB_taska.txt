inheritance basic concept object oriented programming it models reuse existing class code new classes kind relationship

for example house kind building similarly office block kind building both house office block inherit certain characteristics buildings also personal characteristics house may number occupants whereas office block number offices however personal characteristics dont apply types buildings

in example building would considered superclass contains general characteristics objects inherit house office block subclasses specific types specialise characteristics superclass

java allows object inheritance when one class inherits another class public variables methods available subclass

public class shape 

private color colour

public void setcolourcolor newcolour

colour  newcolour





public class circle extends shape 

private int radius

public void setradiusint newradius

radius  newradius





in example circle class subclass shape class the shape class provides public setcolour method available circle class subclasses shape however private variable colour as defined shape class available direct manipulation circle class inherited the circle class specialises shape class means setradius available circle class subclasses circle isnt available superclass shape
