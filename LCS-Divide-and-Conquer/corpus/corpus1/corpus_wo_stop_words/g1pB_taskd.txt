bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities two random events it mainly used calculate probability one events outcome given previous event happened for example probability doctors diagnosis correct given doctor previously observed symptoms patient bayes theorem used forms probability however currently centre debate concerning ways probabilities assigned applications
the theorem states probability event a happening given event b probability b given a multiplied probability a regardless b divided probability b regardless a acts normalising constant bayes theorem formed way basically details ones beliefs event a renewed updated knowing event b happened when calculating conditional probabilities these often useful create table containing number occurrences relative frequencies outcome variables independently
