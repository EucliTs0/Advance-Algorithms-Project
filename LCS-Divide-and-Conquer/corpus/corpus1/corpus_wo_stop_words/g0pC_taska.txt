inheritance object oriented programming new class formed using classes allready defined these classes behavior attributes existent classes inherited from the peropos inheritance object oriented programming minimize reuse existing code without modification

inheritance allowes classes categorized similer way humans catagorize it also provides way generalize du is a relationship classes for example cow generalization animal similarly pigs  cheaters defeining classes way allows us define attributes behaviours commen animals one class cheaters would natuarly inheart properities commen animals

the advantage inheritance classes would otherwise alot similar code  instead shair code thus reducing complexity program inheritance therefore also refered polymorphism many pieces code controled shared control code

inheritance accomplished overriding methods ancestor adding new methods
