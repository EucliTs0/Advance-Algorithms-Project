in probability theory bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities two random events it often used compute posterior probabilities given observations

bayes theorem expressed mathematically as

pab  pbapapb

pab conditional probability a given b pa prior probability a pb prior probability b pba conditional probability b given a

bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities two random events pa pb valid common interpretations probability for example school made 35 boys 25 girls girls wear skirts trousers equal numbers boys wear trousers if student observed distance wearing trousers bayes theorem used determine probability student girl

pa probability student girl which 25
pba probability student wearing trousers given student girl 05
pb probability random student wearing trousers calculated pb  pbapa  pbapa  denotes complementary event 08
therefore probability using formula 025

bayes theorem often used compute posterior probabilities given observations instance probability proposed medical diagnosis correct given certain observed symptoms
