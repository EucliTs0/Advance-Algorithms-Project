the algebraic model representing text documents objects vectors identifiers called vector space model it used information filtering indexing relevancy rankings information retrieval it first used smart information retrieval system
when document represented vector dimension corresponds separate term a term occurs document value vector nonzero other ways computing values weights developed the popular tfidf weighting
depending application definition term varies single words keywords occasionally longer phrases used terms the dimensionality vector words used terms total number words available use by using assumptions document similarities theory relevancy rankings documents keyword search worked comparing deviation angles vectors within document original query vectors type
the limitations vector space model thus due poor similarity values long documents poorly represented false positive matches may returned search keywords precisely match document terms false negative matches could returned documents share context different term vocabulary vector space representation results loss order terms document
