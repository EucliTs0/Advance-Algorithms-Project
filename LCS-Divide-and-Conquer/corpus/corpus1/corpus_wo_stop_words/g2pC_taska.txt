inheritance way form new classes instances called objects using classes already defined the new classes known derived classes take or inherit attributes behavior preexisting classes referred base classes or ancestor classes it intended help reuse existing code little modification

an advantage inheritance modules sufficiently similar interfaces share lot code reducing complexity program inheritance therefore another view dual called polymorphism describes many pieces code controlled shared control code

inheritance typically accomplished either overriding replacing one methods exposed ancestor adding new methods exposed ancestor

in defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restrictions desirable singleness using single inheritance subclass inherit one superclass visibility whenever client code access object generally access objects superclass data static inheritance hierarchy object fixed instantiation objects type selected change time
