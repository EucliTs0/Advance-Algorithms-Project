a vector space model algebraic model representing text documents vectors identifiers a possible use vector space model retrieval filtering information other possible uses vector space models indexing also rank relevancy differing documents
to explain vector space models basically document characterized vector with separate term corresponding differing dimensions there multiple ways trying compute different possible values vector space models recognised tfidf weighting
the differing application direct influence definition term means a normal term usually single word keywords longer phrases the number unique words vocabulary denotes dimensionality words used terms
however whilst vector space modelling useful 4 key problems using it are order terms lost keywords must precise searched for bigger documents poor similarity value due poorly represented two documents based topic wont associated term vocabulary differs
