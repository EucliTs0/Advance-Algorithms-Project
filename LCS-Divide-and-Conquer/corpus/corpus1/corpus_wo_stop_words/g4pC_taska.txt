in objectoriented programming inheritance way form new classes instances called objects using classes already defined the inheritance concept invented 1967 simula
inheritance provides support representation categorization computer languages categorization powerful mechanism number information processing crucial human learning means generalization cognitive economy less information needs stored specific entity particularities
the new classes known derived classes take or inherit attributes behavior preexisting classes referred base classes or ancestor classes it intended help reuse existing code little modification
inheritance also sometimes called generalization isa relationships represent hierarchy classes objects for instance fruit generalization apple orange mango many others one consider fruit abstraction apple orange etc conversely since apples fruit ie apple isa fruit apples may naturally inherit properties common fruit fleshy container seed plant
an advantage inheritance modules sufficiently similar interfaces share lot code reducing complexity program inheritance therefore another view dual called polymorphism describes many pieces code controlled shared control code
inheritance typically accomplished either overriding replacing one methods exposed ancestor adding new methods exposed ancestor
complex inheritance inheritance used within design sufficiently mature may lead yoyo problem
