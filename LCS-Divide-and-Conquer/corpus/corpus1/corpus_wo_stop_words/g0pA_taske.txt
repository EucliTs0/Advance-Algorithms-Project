dynamic programming algorithm design technique used optimisation problems minimising maximising like divide conquer dynamic programming solves problems combining solutions subproblems however unlike divide conquer subproblems always independent subproblems may share subsubproblems solution one subproblem may affect solutions subproblems problem

there four steps dynamic programming

1 characterise structure optimal solution

2 define value optimal solution recursively

3 compute optimal solution values either topdown caching bottomup table

4 construct optimal solution computed values

an example type problem dynamic programming may used is given two sequences xx1xm yy1yn find common subsequence whose length maximum

dynamic programming reduces computation solving subproblems bottomup fashion storing solution subproblem first time solved also looking solution subproblem encountered helps reduce computation however key dynamic programming determine structure optimal solutions
