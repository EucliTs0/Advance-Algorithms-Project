in mathematics computer science dynamic programming methodology solution problems exhibit properties overlapping subproblems optimal substructure described below the methodology takes much less time rather naive methods
the term originally used 1940s richard bellman describe process solving problems one needs find best decisions one another by 1953 refined modern meaning the field founded systems analysis engineering topic recognized ieee bellmans contribution remembered name bellman equation central result dynamic programmer restates optimization problem recursive form
the word programming dynamic programming particular connection computer programming general  instead comes term mathematical programming synonym optimization therefore program optimal plan action produced for example finalized schedule events exhibition sometimes called program
optimal substructure means optimal solutions subproblems used find optimal solutions overall problem for instance shortest path goal vertex graph found first computing shortest path goal adjacent vertices after this using pick best overall path in word solve problem optimal substructure using threestep process
