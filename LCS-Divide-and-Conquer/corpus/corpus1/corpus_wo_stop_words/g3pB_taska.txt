inheritance concept object oriented programming child subclass inherits characteristics parent superclass the concept takes name genetic inheritance child inherit genetic characteristics parents

inheritance simplest allows programmers model relationship one object kind another for instance two classes one representing undergraduate student another representing postgraduate student could said belong generalised class representing students similarly could say dogs cats two kinds animal bridges skyscrapers two types manmade structure

subclasses said extend specialise superclasses attributes variables behaviours functions common classes included definition superclass leaving subclass definitions containing attributes behaviours unique class

inheritance used create multiple level architecture classes in architecture even bottommost subclasses inherit attributes behaviours defined topmost superclasses this save programmer time renders unnecessary lot code duplication
