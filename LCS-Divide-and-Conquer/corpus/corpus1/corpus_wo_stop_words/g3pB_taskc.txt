there large number models used solving problem information retrieval based one three mathematical bases set theory algebra probabilistic the vector space model one methods algebraic model

in vector space model document represented vector within vector dimension corresponds separate term where term typically single word keyword phrase if term doesnt occur within document value vector zero if term occurs document value nonzero

to calculate relevant document keyword search cosine value angle vectors easier calculate instead actual angle

the vector space model however without limitations small similarity values long documents poorly represented order words matter false positive matches may brought terms contained within words themselves documents match use different semantics may return false negative matches there number models based extend vector space model designed try eradicate problems
