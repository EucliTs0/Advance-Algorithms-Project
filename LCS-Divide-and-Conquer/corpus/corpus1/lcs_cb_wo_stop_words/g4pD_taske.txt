the subproblems are themselves solved dividing subsubproblems on reach simple case solvable constant time
overlapping subproblems means subproblems used solve many different larger problems example fibonacci sequence f3  f1  f2 f4  f2  f3 computing number involves computing f2 because f3 f4 needed compute f5 naive approach computing f5 may end computing f2 twice more t as whenever overlapping subproblems naive approach may waste te recomputing optimal solutions already solved subproblems
